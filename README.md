leaderboard details: displays all users in the database. displays user, avg score, adj avg score, total games played, losses, consistency (std dev), current streak, longest streak. sorted by bayesian average with a threshold of 10 (aka adj avg score). each user should have their own row, and their data should all be shown in that single row.

Parsing details: be very lenient/flexible in the parsing. Be aware that multiple users may have the same score. A score of "x/6", as shown in the last example, indicates failure to complete the puzzle. a failed game will simply result in a loss tally for that user, and should not affect avg score calculation

I can help you find user aliases if needed. 


## Planned features

Copy the bot token. Create a .env in the root directory and set the following variable. DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here

set bot permissions
it needs permission to sense message content intent(read messages) and member intent (see member data, such as display name)
it also needs these permissions: send message, read message. use slash commands.

invite the bot.
I generated the invite link through the oauth2 tab becasuse i couldn't get the permissions to stick via the bot tab
