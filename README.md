# Wordle Discord Bot
Self-hosted Discord bot. Gather and display statistics about Wordle games in a Discord channel or thread.

For threads to work, use the latest discord.py version from [this repo](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

## Features
- List all Wordle players
- Show a score of average guesses (lower is better)
- Show each player's streak (useful if playing across multiple devices)
- Reads all previously posted 


## Planned features
- Details for specific players (`!wordle <user>`)
- Count games played on hard mode
- Earliest post in the day on average
- Player with best started word on average
- Fair overall game score (players who play more often get higher scores)


## Requirements
Requires Python 3.8+, [discord.py v1.7.3](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/), [asyncio v.3.4.3](https://pypi.org/project/asyncio/), [emoji v2.0.0](https://pypi.org/project/emoji/), [apscheduler v3.9.1](https://pypi.org/project/APScheduler/).

You can install the requirements with `pip instlall -r requirements.txt`

## Installation
[Create a bot account](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) and invite it to your server.
It requires permission to read historical chat data and post messages.

Set the token in a file in the same directory as `wordle_bot.py` called `secret.py` in which you set `token = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"`.

## Running

Once it is in the server, invoke it in a channel with the command `!wordle`.
On the first run, it will then read through all messages in that channel/thread and store all Wordle scores and streaks (this may take a while, depending on the size of the channel/thread).
After this, it will continously add Wordle scores as they are posted.
